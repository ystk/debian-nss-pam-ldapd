This is nss-pam-ldapd, a library for doging NSS and PAM lookups using an LDAP
server.

nss-pam-ldapd started as nss-ldapd which was a fork from nss_ldap which was
originally written by Luke Howard of PADL Software Pty Ltd.
http://www.padl.com/OSS/nss_ldap.html

In 2006 Arthur de Jong of West Consuling forked the library to split it into a
thin NSS part and a server part. Most of the code was rewritten.

Arthur de Jong is both the upstream and Debian package maintainer, so there
are no differences between the Debian package and the upstream version.

The Debian package of nss-pam-ldapd was partially based on packaging of the
libnss-ldap package. The libnss-ldap package was maintained by Ben Collins,
Davide Puricelli (evo), Sami Haahtinen and Stephen Frost.
